Coding this was the first time I ever experienced "the zone", so it holds a special place in my heart

> The year was 2016. It was a crisp fall evening<br>
> I sat on the floor of a quiet, carpeteted room in the IALC building near my dorm. Yahtzee<br>
> A janitor walked in, looked around, and turned the lights off, failing to notice me<br>
