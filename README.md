Coding this was the first time I ever experienced "the zone", so it holds a special place in my heart

> The year was 2016. It was a crisp fall evening
> I sat on the floor of a quiet, carpeteted room in the IALC building near my dorm. Yahtzee
> A janitor walked in, looked around, and turned the lights off, failing to notice me
> Completely still, I wrote my masterpiece: `void update_score_card(int *dice_values_array, int *options_used, int *score_card_array, int *dice_array, int option)`

# TODO

- Let players play concurrently
- Greedy AI player
